_GBM coding challenge, practical exam_

## Getting Started ðŸš€

_Two screens will be displayed, a list of tickers and the details of tickers._

_Node must be installed, preferably in the latest version._

### Installation ðŸ”§

_First of all, if you are going to run the application locally, you must install and run the backend locally or consume the production service on Vercel._

[BFF Repo](https://github.com/devsoriano/proxy-backend-gbm)

_Create the .env.local file in the project's root directory. If you need the development backend resource, you should enter the following in the file:_

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8080/api"
```

_If you want to point to the production resource in Vite (make sure it is running correctly):_

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL="https://proxy-backend-gbm.vercel.app/api"
```

_Now, run the following command in the project's console:_

```
npm install
```

_Once the Node utilities are installed, run:_

```
npm run dev
```

_Go to the URL:_

```
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```
